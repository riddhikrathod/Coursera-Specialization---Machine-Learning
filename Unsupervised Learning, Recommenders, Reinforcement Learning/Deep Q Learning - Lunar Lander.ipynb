    "## Lunar Lander Enviornment\n",
    "- We use OpenAI's gym library that provides a wide variety of enviornments for reinf learning. An enviornment represents a problem or a task to be solved.\n",
    "- The landing flag is designated by 2 flag poles and it is always at coordinates (0,0) but the lunar lander is allowed to land outside of the landing pad.\n",
    "- The lander starts at the top center of the enviornment with a random initial force appolied to its centre of mass and also it has infinite fuel. The enviornment is considered solved on getting 200 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Action Space\n",
    "The agent has 4 discrete actions available:\n",
    "1. Do nothing (corresponding value = 0)\n",
    "2. Fire right engine (corresponding value = 1)\n",
    "3. Fire main engine (corresponding value = 2)\n",
    "4. Fire left engine (corresponding value = 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observation Space\n",
    "The agents observation space consists of a state vector with 8 variables:\n",
    "* Its $(x,y)$ coordinates. The landing pad is always at coordinates $(0,0)$.\n",
    "* Its linear velocities $(\\dot x,\\dot y)$.\n",
    "* Its angle $\\theta$.\n",
    "* Its angular velocity $\\dot \\theta$.\n",
    "* Two booleans, $l$ and $r$, that represent whether each leg is in contact with the ground or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rewards\n",
    "The lunar lander enviornment has the following reward system:\n",
    "* Landing on the landing pad and coming to rest is about 100-140 points.\n",
    "* If the lander moves away from the landing pad, it loses reward. \n",
    "* If the lander crashes, it receives -100 points.\n",
    "* If the lander comes to rest, it receives +100 points.\n",
    "* Each leg with ground contact is +10 points.\n",
    "* Firing the main engine is -0.3 points each frame.\n",
    "* Firing the side engine is -0.03 points each frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Episode Termination\n",
    "An episode ends if:\n",
    "* The lunar lander crashes (i.e if the body of the lunar lander comes in contact with the surface of the moon).\n",
    "* The lander's $x$-coordinate is greater than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load the enviornment\n",
    "We use the gym library to initiate the lunar lander enviornment. Once we load the enviornment, we rest its initial state. We then render the frame"
